( there was actually a single user with 21 sessions ! ) we had to "" bounce "" the server twice to bring the system back to its normal level of performance . the good news is that we found out what caused the problem . it was not a particular user or a particular report or process . it was actually an intentional change to a specific table that we have done numerous times in the past , but this particular change had drastic side effects . we have contacted sybase with this problem to see if they can help determine if the behavior is a "" feature "" or a bug . in the meanwhile , we will do these types of changes at night during scheduled outages . i apologize for the frustration , anxiety , and extra work brought on by this problem and will take every precaution to see that it does not happen again . if you have any further questions or comments , please feel free to give me a call . dave n .","ham"

"Subject: enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 26 , 2001 enbridge buys koch ' s east texas midstream assets for $ 231 m enbridge energy partners lp is buying gas gathering , treating , processing and transmission assets in east texas from koch midstream services for $ 230 . 5 million . the package includes all of the east texas system , which gathers 400 mmcf / d for delivery into the carthage hub . enbridge energy company president dan c . tutcher said the assets are a "" natural fit "" with enbridge ' s existing texas assets and will significantly expand the company ' s "" geographic footprint "" in the region as well as its energy commodity mix . "" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' ' enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december . the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy . it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure . enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications . third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d . "" the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , "" said tutcher . "" the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

"Subject: please read this hi there hope you don ' t mind me contacting you , but i thought you may be interested in this , as like me , you are obviously serious about making some money . . . i have heard nothing but great things about this . so give it a shot .  5 . . . that ' s all it takes . . . i ' ll keep it short and sweet . to get started just right mouse click and copy this whole page and paste it in an e - mail to edit it . once i got started the money started rolling in ! ! ! just like the plan below said it would ! i am currently getting over  200 a day and just started weekago ! ! ! ! ! believe it or not , this is my 2 nd time around . simply follow the instructions below and in 2 to 3 weeks , you will have at least  20 , 000 in your paypal account . most people respond to this program because of the low investment (  5 ) and high profit potential . the return rate is currently 50 % to 80 % . there is no limit to the income you can generate from this business ( you can do it over and over ) . this program is the fastest , easiest program you will ever do . the only down fall is when people try to put their address in the # 1 place . if they do that they will only reach the people they initially send to , and only make a few pounds . if you follow the instructions you will reach thousands of people ! honesty , faith and integrity make this system work . team work makes the dream work ! lets get started ! i think everyone has heard of "" paypal "" ( if not you will ) . paypal ( owned by ebay ) is the simplest method of making and receiving payments online . anyone with an email address can join for free ! if you ' re not already a paypal user , the first thing you need to do is go to paypal and sign up for free : use the link above to sign up for a free account , then send a  5 . 00 donation from your paypal account ( you will earn back  5 . 00 from paypal , for signing up anyway ! ) to only the first email address on the list along with a note saying : "" please add me to your mailing list "" . now send an email to the 4 th person on the list saying "" thanks i ' ve joined "" . then , remove the first email address and place your address at the bottom . this should move the second place into the first place and the third place into second and fourth into the third . don ' t try to place yourself in the first place . it will only reach the people you send it to , and then your name will be removed from the lst place by that person and this will not make the system work . if you do this the way it was designed it will reach thousands by the time your name gets to the top . remember to only send a  5 . 00 donation to the first e - mail address , and send "" thanks i ' ve joined "" to the fourth person . this lets the 4 th person keep track of their progress . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 1 . siberiantigergrowl @ hotmail . com 2 . jemimajones _ 7 @ hotmail . com 3 . @ hotmail . com 4 . nic @ madstock . freeserve . co . uk now that you have made your donation to the first person and sent the fourth person a note , place your email address in the fourth place ( make sure its the same email address you used for your paypal account ) this is the way you will receive payment . ok , the only thing left to do is email out at least 20 copies or more ( ! ) of this letter in a week or so . when your name reaches the top of the list it will be your turn to collect your money from 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people just like yourself who are willing to spend  5 . 00 and half an hour of there time to receive  20 , 000 in cash ! keep in mind . . . the most you ' ve spent is  5 . testimonials : d . rayner london : i only have one thing to say to you . . . . oh my god ! i sent out 40 copies like the instructions said and left on holiday . when i got back my account had over  12 , 000 in it already ! i ' m still floating on air ( especially with my new car i bought ! ) ! thanks ! this programe works , it really does . so good luck to the rest of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !","spam"

( pink sheets : ) , a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in locating and provide managerial , accounting and financing for companies in the energy field , from oil and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft you may ask ; why the energy related field ? simply it currently offers many opportunities and with the price of oil approaching $ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth to be made in this sector . according to adjusted inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this year alone , most of which is because of china . the increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented in stone . there are more players in the world economy today that require oil gas to propel their own economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself with individuals that have experience in the energy field . these individuals will help locate viable opportunities and the funding necessary to participate in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira so what do we do with our non - energy related businesses such as fine wein records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will continue to incubate and nurture these businesses until they are at a level where they can move on their own . i believe that both of these companies will be strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the basic premise of our business module whereby we share the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing public our portfolio companies . we can then continue to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw by concentrating on a specific sector such as the energy area we will be able to define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our goal will be to locate and make investments in no less than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative way to participate in the booming oil gas and energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm fine wein records , inc . announces compilation music deal for theworld - renowned ` i love ny ' logo fine wein records , inc . , a subsidiary of atlantis business development corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) , announced today that it has licensed from cmg worldwide inc . the world - renowned i love ny logo . the product will be distributed at traditional music retail outlets and specialty stores . jwnvunffagsmjw rich weinman of fine wein records , inc adds , this special logo is world renown and we expect both retailers and specialty stores to share our excitement . the compilation will feature songs from tony bennet , johhny mathis , liza minnelli , bobby darin , joel grey and many more . weinman adds , what could be more perfect but music legends appearing together in a common theme in songs about the greatest city in the world . jdvgbpytgmnxwj atlantis business development corporation retains investor growth , inc . atlantis business development corporation ( otcbb : abdv ) is pleased to announce that its has retained investor growth , inc . to assist with investment banking , business development , and investor relations . investor growth , inc . has arranged $ 300 , 000 of equity financing and will participate in future financing rounds . bcwlbmh atlantis business development corporation strong revenue continues atlantis business development corporation ( otcbb : abdv ) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned multimedia marketing company , e - direct , inc . , has booked another $ 32 , 500 . 00 in revenues in its 2 nd full week of full operation , and anticipates several other contracts for the month of july . c . michael dubeau , e - direct president , stated , e - direct ' s projections for its lst quarter of full operation were $ 450 , 000 . 00 in the original pro forma . we have already produced $ 115 , 000 . 00 in the first two weeks of operation . if this continues we expect our revenues for e - direct , inc . to be around $ 600 , 000 . 00 for the quarter ending september 30 , 2004 . vamdauw atlantis business development corporation ( otcbb : abdv ) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned multimedia marketing company , e - direct , inc . , has already booked $ 82 , 500 in revenues in its first full week of full operation , and is well ahead of its forecast for the quarter . oevxisg atlantis business development corporation , inc .

"Subject: market watch undervalued report f april 2004 top pick of the month life energy and technology holdings , inc . ( otcbb : leth ) leth receives $ 250 , 000 , 000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste - to - energy units in the united states . first unit to roll - out in new orleans in early second quarter . we are expecting earth - shattering upcoming news leading a strong rally in leth for a company that has announced over $ 100 million in sales orders in the past year , and tops that record - setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $ 8 . 62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion . * * our readers grabbed substantial profits for our march pick * * ushg featured at . 75 reached 3 . 65 in 8 days ! traded as high as 7 . 00 since ! the biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand : leth is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour which makes a major impact on the global waste problem . this profitable and environmentally safe process converts into clean , green electricity such waste materials as municipal solid waste , agricultural wastes , forestry wastes , medical wastes , industrial wastes , sewage sludge , shale oil , sour natural gas , and the huge market of used tires . leth profits from the sale of electricity created from the waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega - watts per hour of electricity which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid . the biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost - effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste . leth has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be the hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures . financing of $ 250 million positions leth for astronomical sales : the magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this $ 1 . 50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to $ 8 . 62 per common share in cash . there are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide . the available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres . now factor in that the average sale price is $ 7 million per biosphere . we cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential $ 700 , 000 , 000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding ! leth stock guidance : current price : 1 . 80 near - term target : 4 . 80 projected high for ' 04 : 12 . 50 leth ' s blue chip partner - fortifying the system : leth is an alliance partner with tetra tech , inc .

( mrs . ) mariam abacha , the wife of late general sani abacha ( former military head of state and president of the federal republic of nigeria ) who died suddenly on 8 th june 1998 . i got your contact on the internet as i was making contact for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children , hence our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband . i have lost confidence with anybody within the country . having noted the confidence reposed on your person , i became convinced of your capability and goodwill to assist me in receiving the sum of us $ 20 million secretly willed in my favour by the late general ( my husband ) . this money was kept in a security company in amsterdam holland and i have all documents with me as of when it was deposited in a security vault for safe keeping . this money has been defaced for security reasons and also to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons . it is not an ill gotten wealth rather , it was generated from my organisation family support program ( f . s . p ) . i will enlighten you more of this organisation if you indicate a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf . on your acceptance to render this assistance to me to invest this fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it will be used for non - speculative investments in your country . however , the current civilian administration of retired general olusegun obasanjo ( the president of the federal republic of nigeria ) is seeking vengeance on the abacha family because of the life prison jail sentence confirmed on him by my late husband while in office . in pursuit of this vendetta , the present government have resolved to freeze all known assets of general sani abacha including properties at home and abroad and are presently embarking on to seize the various bank accounts of my husband in swizerland , uk , australia . in fact , the attack on our family ( the abacha ' s ) is so devastated to an extent of seizing our travelling passport , family accounts and even trying some members of our family in court for offences allegedly committed by my late husband . in view of this grevious threat to our economic and personal survival , our family trustee have secretly protected the will , the security company has called me to do something about claiming this consignment because of the demurrage it is incurring and i told them we would come and claim it very soon . but my son seriously advised me to move the fund into an overseas amount , hence the reason why i have chosen you and hope that you will come to my full assistance and unlimited co - operation . in the meantime , there is a travelling embargo on us ( the whole family members ) and our local accounts are seized . we are currently living on goodwill of people who believe we cannot be held responsible for the sins of my late husband . in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this distressed call to save me and my children from a hopeless future . and if you agree to help , we will compensate you sincerely for your candid effort in this regard with 25 % of the total amount of $ 20 million us dollars . in that case , when the money ( $ 20 million ) is moved into your discrete account , you will be allowed to withdraw 25 % in your favour , while 10 % has been set aside for any expenses you might incur ( there are demurrage to pay before the consignment is sign and claimed by you . ) during the process of securing this consignment . the remaining 65 % will be invested meaningfully for my children ' s future . my cousin ( dr . yemi musa ) has perfected arrangements with the trust company concerned and has been assured 100 % risk free and safe operation . what i demand from you now is to arrange to visit the finance company where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona - fide owner . and in due course , all contacts must be made through dr yemi musa through this e - mail : address yemimusa 2 @ hotvoice . com and phone : 00221 512 48 59 . senegal . i look forward to your quick response while thanking you for your co - operation . in view of all above details , i request you to keep this letter and co - operation highly confidential . best wishes , mrs . mariam abacha .","spam"

"Subject: tenaska iv gas are you going to make the price changes to the tenaska iv sale 384258 for 10 / 00 and 11 / 00 that james details below ? right now , we are showing a short pay of $ 351 , 201 . 49 for those two months . megan - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by megan parker / corp / enron on 12 / 29 / 2000 11 : 46 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - james armstrong @ ect 12 / 19 / 2000 10 : 31 am to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect cc : megan parker / corp / enron @ enron , jody pierce / hou / ect @ ect , mike mazowita / corp / enron @ enron , garrick hill / hou / ect @ ect subject : tenaska iv gas daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled ) : 1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 ) and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary - 230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at 2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 . 2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged $ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91 price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at 2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 . i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for 2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at . 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu . in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 . looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of $ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) . so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of $ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity . month plant gas price amount november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843 november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 ) october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 ) nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000 sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52 total $ 484 , 234 . 03 i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks . james","ham"

"Subject: sitara position please use the position manager home button . when using the sitara position manager , and you drill down to view details or change the dates , the position manager keeps all your views running in the background . this feature allows you to use the back and forward buttons to keep your views running . on the downside , if you keep these views running but do not really intend to go back to look at them , the system and your pc are working harder to keep all the old views active and updated . the home button sends you back to your default view - the first view you had up when you hit apply . by clicking this button , your position manager will clear out the old views the next time you drill in . this is the only way to clear out the old views that you no longer need . if you do not use the home key , and keep drilling in and changing the dates , the position manager is still keeping all the your views for the day running in the backgound . what we have found is by the end of the day , a user that does not clear out the old views can have well over 30 views open , which is like having 30 position managers up on your pc . when that user closes down , the position gets locked up for a while as it tries to clear out all the old views . we will be making some changes soon to that should resolve this issue as far as the sitara machine is concerned ; however , your pc may still be slow with excessive unneccessary views open . we could make a change to limit the number of active views you can have open , but at this time i am not sure that is necessary ; regardless , in the mean time , please remember to use your home button . other helpful hints - did you know you can shrink you tool bar ? tools options - uncheck show tool bar text labels - did you know you can split your position screen to have pipes on top and zones and meters below ? tools options - show drill down second panel - if you have an omicron position porfolio - your min / max button shows you actual - and min / max for your day swing deals . same works for nom flex portfolio .","ham"

"Subject: re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18 mary , hplc meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in december , 1999 . typically , before hpl physically pulls a meter , production has ceased at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released . in the case of the roos common point , the producing wells were released and attached to meter 0989740 in 11 / 98 and the remaining wells are non - producing . resultingly , the only viable option for resolution is option 2 . we should take the deal to zero by "" unwinding "" it . vlt x 3 - 6353 mary poorman @ enron 10 / 24 / 2000 12 : 40 pm to : vance l taylor / hou / ect @ ect cc : katherine benedict / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , pat clynes / corp / enron @ enron , robert cotten / hou / ect @ ect subject : re : meter 984229 - roos common point - trade zone 18 vance : per our conversation , we have two possible options to resolve this deal , depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not . producing : if that is the case , the purchase from calpine , and any contracts hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level . once that is done , i will need to research in the system how those wellheads were allocated and paid and reallocate to your calpine deal . this will probably have to go back to hplc ' s ownership of hplr ' s gathering assets . non - producing : should we determine that the common point and any wells behind it have been shut - in , or p & a ' d , we will need to reallocate this deal to zero , and unwind any hedges against it ( or , move the hedges to another deal , if possible . since the deal is older , we probably sold lower priced contracts against the production and a buy - back today would possibly result in a financial loss ) . in either case , the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow at meter 4229 , which i am currently looking into . i will email you as soon as i ascertain that date . in lieu of the past couple of days , we may need to look at all of the deals which were impacted by hplc ' s aquisition of hplr ' s gathering to ensure that they are being captured properly , both at a book level and at a state filing level . please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish this . thank you again for all of your hard work in this area , mary","ham"
"Subject: king ranch there are two fields of gas that i am having difficulty with in the unify system . 1 . cage ranch - since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this gas on king ranch , it is my understanding hpl is selling the liquids and king ranch is re - delivering to stratton . it is also my understanding that there is a . 05 cent fee to deliver this gas . we need a method to accomodate the volume flow on hpl at meter 415 and 9643 . this gas will not be reflected on trans . usage ticket # 123395 and # 95394 since it is not being nominated from a processing agreement . we either , need to input a point nom ( on hpl or krgp ) at these meters to match the nom at meter 9610 , or a deal for purchase and sale ( if king ranch is taking title to the gas ) needs to be input into sitara at these meters with the appropriate rate . i have currently input a point nom on krgp to accomodate this flow , so we can divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made . 2 . forest oil - there is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow from the meter ( 6396 ) into king ranch . it is my understanding that this agreement was originally setup until texaco had their own processing agreement . i need confirmation that the gas from this meter should be nominated on contract # ( 96006681 ) and that this agreement should have been reassigned to hplc . ( it is currently still under hplr ) . if this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement , then once again we need to accomodate the flow volume on the hpl pipe with either a point nom or a sitara deal at meters 415 and 9643 .","ham"

"Subject: king ranch i just spoke briefly with brian riley , who is working to restructure the knig ranch contracts with exxon , and put coastal into the loop . yesterday i forwarded each of you an e - mail from steve van hooser which had drafts of contracts attached . as i talked with brian , the king ranch set up as he is negotiating will be simplified . the intent , as i understood it , is that we will no longer buy at the wellhead . rather , coastal is entering into a a gathering agreement with hpl to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant . hplc will buy at the tailgate of the plant , net of pvr . so there will not be future settlements with exxon on liquids . the paper has not been returned from coastal or exxon yet , but the deal is effective 4 / 1 / 00 . everything will be under new agreements , with receipts and deliveries by different counterparties . the gas flow continues the same , just under new contracts and different counterparties . daren , pat and stella : daren , brian said he would get with you to discuss the deal in further detail . please include pat and stella in the discussion also . the contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper scheduling . as i mentioned to greg sharp and brian , it is critical that we be kept in the loop , especially on retroactive deals , as scheduling , transport rates and risk are affected . thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place .","ham"

to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you currently have or will have one in your rc for the year 2000 . the analyst program is being handled differently than it was in 1999 . in addition to the normal salary , benefits and payroll taxes , you will also be charged an overhead administration fee for the program . you will be charged the following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that i have indicated below : detail class description amount 1 salaries and wages $ 4 , 000 552 benefits 774 557 payroll taxes 360 820 corporate services 1 , 266 total monthly cost $ 6 , 400 the $ 4000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not indicate what the analyst in your rc is paid . this amount will not change in february as the $ 4000 already includes merit raise information for 2000 . the $ 1266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program , including campus recruiting and office visits . when you look at your rc report , you will see a line item labeled "" a and a reclass "" in each of the detail classes identified above . enron north america is invoiced by corp . for the costs of all analysts . financial operations makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate rc . please check your january 2000 rc report and make sure you were properly charged for the correct number of analysts you have currently . if there are any errors , please let me know as soon as possible so that i can work with brian heinrich to have it corrected in february . please continue to check your rc report

"Subject: fyi - new product on eol just so everyone is on the same page : based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends . this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month increments . it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these trades will error out and will have to be entered manually . an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this nature will have to be entered manually . how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know . the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal accordingly . for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april : four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara ticket start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07 04 / 10 04 / 14 04 / 17 04 / 21 04 / 24 04 / 28 each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade . also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date is on the path ; otherwise the number of reconciling items will increase . please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted . any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself . srm ( x 33548 )","ham"

use of bible reading from public schools a few years ago . now her organization has been granted a federal hearing on the same subject by the federal communications commission ( fcc ) in washington , dc . their petition , number 2493 , would ultimately pave the way to stop the reading of the gospel our lord and savior , and the airwaves of america . they got 287 , 000 signatures to back their stand ! if this attempt is successful , all sunday worship services being broadcast on the radio or by television will be stopped . this group is also campaigning to remove all christmas programs and christmas carols from public schools ! ! you as a christian can help ! we are praying for at least 1 million signatures . this would defeat their effort and how that there are many christians alive , well and concerned about our country . as christians we must unite on this . please don ' t take this lightly . we ignored this lady once and lost prayer in our school and in offices across the nation . please stand up for your religious freedom and let your voice be heard . together we can make a difference in our country while creating an opportunity for the lost to know the lord . please press

"Subject: god bless you dr . nkem george . bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . my dear friend , i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria . i have an urgent and very profitable business proposition for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality . on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and contractor with the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred united states dollars only ) in my branch . upon maturity i sent a routine notification in accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the nigerian national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james herbert died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , we found out that he died without making a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of my bank to a security company in europe for safekeeping . no one will ever come forward to claim it and according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and half years the money will revert to the ownership of the nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund . this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6 million u . s dollars that is presently in a security company in europe . i contacted you because it is against our code of ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your assistance would be needed to claim the money in the security company in europe . we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum would be for you if you agree to take part in this profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay back the expenses that may be incurred during the course of the transaction by both parties after the fund has been claimed and lodged in your account . in the event that you are genuinely interested in the transaction , the following information would be needed from you to expedite action . 1 ) your full name and address that would be used to establish you as the next of kin of our late client thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund . this would ensure that the security company in europe releases the consignment / fund to you . 2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where you can be reached at all time because this transaction entails constant communication . the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of the transaction . if you are interested , send the requested information via email i await your response urgently . regards , dr . nkem george . .","spam"

mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market . our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines . i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron . the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n . america , as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl . our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations , field operations , engineering , producer services , and marketing skills to capture value from transportation , gathering , storage and commodity opportunities on the gas / power grids . we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n . america . we have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powder / wind river pipelines , installing electric compressors , contracting for processing capacity , and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast . our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations , measurement , trading / marketing , and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunity . it is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties . please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns . also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determing .

"Subject: please read - important information for participants in the enron savings plan due to current business circumstances , on november 28 , 2001 , enron ' s board of directors adopted an amendment to the enron corp . savings plan . the amendment includes the following changes , which became effective on november 29 : ? savings plan contributions that are deducted from your november 30 paycheck will be matched by enron in cash rather than enron stock . the cash match will be placed into the fidelity freedom 2000 fund , the default fund for the plan . ? after november 30 , enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions . as an exception , the company will continue the union matching contributions to the plan . ? the savings plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in enron stock or one or more alternative investment options . effective immediately , diversification within the plan will also be allowed , regardless of your age , from company contribution accounts . this removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account . these accounts include all prior company contributions , qnec , and company match accounts . to move funds : on the web , choose "" savings plan - - restricted employer acct transfer / reallocation "" from the drop down menu . on voice response , choose "" request for fund transfer / reallocation of your restricted employer accounts . "" this will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts : company matching , union matching , prior matching , and qnec . to avoid phone delays , we recommend that you access your account through the web at http : / / resources . hewitt . com / enron or through benefits . enron . com .","ham"

"Subject: cleco deals 449243 & 397957 / state tract 121 ( meter 785 ) fred or anita , i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the same page . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121 is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculate flow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us an allocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general land and hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor was put in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as the gas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured at meter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meter statement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done , she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now a check meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter . for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957 and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifer martinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use 449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroed out the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal 449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal 449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generate for 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . the allocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure that bryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtis funderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences . in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be a callout \ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volume should be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . then byancy should take this net number and split it between texas general land and hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 and the hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas general land nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided on that yet . please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding or you need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to be doing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one person doing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !","ham"
