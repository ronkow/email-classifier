( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services . 2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 .

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .","ham"

"Subject: fw : classic thoughts on texas a & m . . . fox sports show host jim rome 1 ) they won ' t shut up . they have to go on about spirit , and old army , and red ass , and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have in their urine to beat ut , and blah blah blah . shut up . you start to get the feeling the entire school was built to spite ut . 2 ) forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 ' s passed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have a subsidiary branch of the main school ( university of texas ) that would teach agriculture and mechanics . aggies love to say their school is older , from where they get that i don ' t now . . . . . . the fact is , the state intended a & m to be a branch of ut . they are like the afterbirth fromthe original creation . like danny devito in "" twins "" . 3 ) so they apparently have this complex , so much so , that they must devote their entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good . all the while , nobody at ut denies that a & m is a good school , yet they won ' t shut up . so they write a fight song . . . . . . about ? . . . . texas , and how they want to beat them . they have a fish camp for freshman where they tell them how bad texas is and how good a & m and all its traditions are . it is the world ' s largest known case of penis envy , and it is manifested in everything a & m does . 4 ) the people at a & m . now we all have friends who went to a & m or are at a & m . there are some nice people there . however . . . there is the corp . east texas ' answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere . for every boy scout who never learned to stop playing with his gi joe toys , there is the corp . now , forget the fact that a however , nobody respects the corp . i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock of the military world . just because you dress like the army , and try and act like the army , does not make you the army . people at a & m don ' t even respect these clowns . it is not cool to shave your head and dress up . halloween is only supposed to be one day of the year . if you want to carry guns and beat up civilians , move to israel . 5 ) it is even less cool to slobber on somebody ' s daughter on national television and call it a tradition . dry humping 18 year old girls in the stands at football games is not cool . not only is it not cool , it should be against the law . i know that in college station , students are just prone to mount each other on the campus lawn , or in the middle of class , or anytime anything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you and start sucking on her face . but everywhere else in the world , it is looked down upon . especially if you are doing it on my tv . that is why we have moved the game from thanksgiving . because people across the nation were gagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game , some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co - ed during somebody ' s thanksgiving dinner . we do not need to see burly women engaged in a suckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board . some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the clinique counter . screw that , forget make - up , it is too late for that , just give them a veil . 6 ) "" t . u . "" is not funny . it is not insulting . it is dumb . just imagine if folks from texas kept talking about m & a and giggling . that would not be funny . in fact , it would be retarded . that ' s why ut fans don ' t do it . please learn . 7 ) you want to lose the image of country bumpkins , of a people fond of sheep , of people that aren ' t stupid ? then quit building things that fall down . quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv . quit whooping in church . quit whooping period . quit putting up scoreboards for the enjoyment of dead mammals . quit spending your friday nights practicing how to yell . quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you ' re running for governor . when you are filling out season ticket renewals , and the form asks for your phone # , h & w , quit putting 258 - 3999 , height 6 ' 3 "" , weight 185 . just , collectively , stop making asses of yourselves . go to east texas , tour every small town , and ask every red neck with a 5 th grade education why they cheer for a & m and wear maroon . that is your fan base . this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid . 8 ) nobody cares if you think your band is better . they might be louder , they might march in neat little zig zags , but they have no musical ability . the point is , nobody cares who wins halftime . quit getting geeked up about marching bands . i find it hard to believe you stood through your high school band ' s entire halftime performance . and why ? cause nobody cared then and nobody cares now . plus , you can hear them fine sitting down even if you do care . why is it cool all of a sudden now that you ' re in college ? 9 ) men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds . perhaps the only justifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during an anal probe . oh wait . . . i understand now . 10 ) dogs are not ladies . they don ' t look or smell like ladies . dogs eat their own feces and should be treated accordingly . 11 ) finally , college station is an arm - pit of a town . quit pretending that it is a great college town . it is a town and there is a college there . that should be the end of this comparison . if you feel that life doesn ' t get any better than the dixie chicken , and enjoy being stuck in a never ending "" dukes of hazard "" episode , then move there . more importantly , don ' t move to austin . . . . . they are trying to create an educated , technological , and open minded population base . austin is , and will continue to be , the birthplace and final resting place of all that is cool . as my friend stephen johnson once said : "" if the world were ever to get an enema , college station is where you would connect the hose . "" if you go to school at a & m , please don ' t be an aggie . god bless the great state of texas . brian puls software engineer lockheed martin - enterprise solutions 281 218 - 2740","ham"

"Subject: proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate . previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates . the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to . commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . "" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . "" wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

( source : company website ) currently trading at . 012 p possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has started and is expected to last all week . pp imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so if you had the scoop on the following stock : p ( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in price because they are promoted , making a very large number of investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxpp about the company : p delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all located over what management considers to be some of the most prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those found in north america . p the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company moves forward . p among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p delta has experienced significant technical success since its start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further exploration is justified . p delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and finance additional exploration . p in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an extensive exploration program . pp ( source : company website ) p recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in preparation of work program . p delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold exploration findings in south america . p delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond exploration in south america . pp will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of the stock this weekend and next week ?

hurricane / bridgeline status here is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v . between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline pipeline systems : summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 % enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted . enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand that accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv will start in early february for march production . to do ' s : accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks . pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my request . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs . networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a combination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been requested . location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv . currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done . data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and meter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need . we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know who else will need access . interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada application : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface . there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s rtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is complete . scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to enron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to them via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transition . accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to be better defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process started . hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customer . please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reached at 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy","ham"

( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to get this assigned ? i can find old notes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to let me know . lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports for ena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 . midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( and dec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 with transport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as it stands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? i thought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong . channel industries pipeline - several issues here : 1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were left unpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately . someone needs to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero , that were nominated for january . 2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . this issue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannot allocate was is not pathed and nominated . 3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 6203 10 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe in dec . who is this assigned to for jan ? hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for december and january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get back next week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return . pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 to the present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you can proceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassigned issues . hank eisenhours duties were split : mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts , december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues . carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and all offsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and stacey also handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gas for december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly . hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible for pathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify . hpl operational seems to be left unassigned . i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanks responsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .","ham"

"Subject: new tax law update whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes . many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years . but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include : lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 . and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new 10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an opportunity to invest more toward your various goals . education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will improve education savings tools such as : ? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to $ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education expenses . ? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 , distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to their generous contribution limits . ? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher education expenses . ? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses , this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college . previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600 in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and thereafter . higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include : ? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 . after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments . ? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older . and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that apply to you and help you make the most of them . as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes . such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your finances . let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you . byron "" make all you can , save all you can , give all you can .

"Subject: jump in to gain substantial ground immediately we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project . symbo | - mogi current price - . 26 reasons to consider mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . breaking news ! ! april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after . the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description . project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres ( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . land discussion our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice .","spam"

"Subject: re : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) fyi . . . . this change went in for the deal validation group . it gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back . impact to logistics - unify if a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed , it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take place . one problem may be with the imbalance data sets , which are not in production yet . . . . . . ( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

"Subject: re : hungry mhetor cheating on spouse i ' ve heard a lot about youlaagan i must have women - - there is nothing unbends the mind like them . all fair in love and war . much violence is based on the illusion that life is a property to be defended and not to be shared . life is not a problem to be solved , but a reality to be experienced . our thoughts take the wildest flight : even at the moment when they should arrange themselves in thoughtful order . kids use to ask where they came from , now they tell you where to go i don ' t want to do business with those who don ' t make a profit , because they can ' t give the best service . the liberals can understand everything but people who don ' t understand them . a lie can run around the world six times while the truth is still trying to put on its pants . beware of no man more than of yourself we carry our worst enemies within us . death , so called , is a thing which makes men weep , and yet a third of life is passed in sleep . rest not . life is sweeping by go and dare before you die . something mighty and sublime , leave behind to conquer time . listen ! encourage . say something . do something . be yourself . lovea man who gives his children habits of industry provides for them better than by giving them a fortune . getting divorced just because you don ' t love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do . force without forecast is to little avail . the problems of this world are only truly solved in two ways : by extinction or duplication . our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us .","spam"

"Subject: re : big cowboy for august mary : is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow ? the large variance between confirmed and actuals began in june 2000 where 30 mmbtu was scheduled for dix ranch and zero for the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . it appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at despain where 985 , 350 mmbtu was confirmed . this well has never flowed this much volume , and in june 2000 it flowed approximately 320 , 000 mmbtu . do we actually have support ( i . e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet ) for the 985 , 350 mmbtu that was entered into mops as confirmed ? this trend of "" nothing "" being confirmed at these three wells continued until july 2000 . in august 2000 this scenario changed and 612 , 388 was confirmed at dix ranch and nothing was scheduled at the big cowboy and big cowboy # 2 wells . from reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at these wells that we expected . if the issue is an actual increase in the volumes flowing at these wells , i would suggest that you call our gas measurement department and ask them to audit coral ' s charts . coral may be is calculating the volumes incorrectly . this could also be an allocations issue . the allocation as it is in the system today closely agrees with the allocation statement that i receive monthly from karen lambert at tejas . the only differences between the tejas schedule and what is in mops are the acock production and gain or loss which are not scheduled and therefore not allocated . i know that you are working on the acock production and tom acton and i are working on the gain / loss . tom will tell me how to path the gas so that i can set up accounting arrangements for april 1999 forward . scheduling will have analyze and possibly rework january through march 1999 because these months were originally set up in pops . i want to help , so if i have missed the issue ( s ) would you please clarify it or them for me and let me know if i need to do anything for you . thanks , fred tom acton @ enron 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 10 am to : fred boas / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : big cowboy for august - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by tom acton / corp / enron on 09 / 28 / 2000 08 : 09 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - mary poorman 09 / 27 / 2000 03 : 56 pm to : daren j farmer / hou / ect @ ect , tom acton / corp / enron @ enron cc : clem cernosek / hou / ect @ ect , howard b camp / hou / ect @ ect subject : big cowboy for august daren & tom , beginning with august production , i noticed that big cowboy , into king ranch appeared to be flowing approximately 9 m over the nomination / day . per a conversation i had with fred boas today , i discovered that two wells with zero noms flowed a considerable volume . they are as follows : rocher big cowboy ( 27002 ) - 42 , 000 approx . big cowboy # 2 ( 27003 - 84 , 000 approx . total flow : 126 , 000 mm ' s , more or less i think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying to account for , in addition to the acock production at the briscoe well which came on in august . please let me know what you think . i would like to make sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and our economics . thank you , mary","ham"

"Subject: enron announces plans to merge with dynegy today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction . deal terms - - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing . - - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas . - - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares . - - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year . enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary . management of newly formed company chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo . i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron . management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined . the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible . as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses . i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 . i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse . and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron . investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ;

( trb , 40 . 00 , pe 24 ) are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies . cdyv represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a share price of 5 . 00 for cdyv would be a very conservative valuation . it is only a matter of time before detailed information is released out into the investment community . by receiving this email , you are among the first public investors to know about cdyv . get in now before the crowds take it to the moon . please read - the information and opinions in this featured profile are based on sources believed to be reliable but no representation is made to its accuracy or completeness . past performance is not an indicator of future results . this report is a paid profile for information purposes only and should not be used as the basis for any investment decision . this newsletter has been compensated ten thousand dollars for the preparation of this profile and for continuing cover age of the featured company . newsletter publishers are not investment advisors and this profile is not to be considered investment advice . this information is neither a solicitation to buy nor an offer to sell securities . information herein contains future - looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties . there are no shares presently held and no participation will occur in the trading of shares in any profiled company .","spam"

"Subject: california energy crisis california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron  , s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities . increasing supply california  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .","ham"

"Subject: ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity ngi ' s daily gas price index published : october 17 , 2001 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline . existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities . "" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] . existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . "" given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 . the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders . but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted .","ham"

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system "" autonoms "" so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .","ham"

"Subject: cleburne issues daren , with megan gone i just wanted to touch base with you on the status of the enron payments owed to the cleburne plant . the current issues are as follows : november gas sales $ 600 , 377 . 50 october payment to ena for txu pipeline charges $ 108 , 405 . 00 cleburne receivable from enron $ 708 , 782 . 50 less : november gas agency fees ( $ 54 , 000 . 00 ) net cleburne receivable from enron $ 654 , 782 . 50 per my discussions with megan , she stated that about $ 500 k of the $ 600 k nov gas sales was intercompany ( desk to desk ) sales , with the remainder from txu . are we able to settle any intercompany deals now ? are we able to settle with txu ? additionally , you ' ll see that i included the oct txu payment in the receivable owed to cleburne also . this is because i always pay megan based upon the pipeline estimates in michael ' s file , even though they are not finalized until the next month . therefore in my november payment to enron , i paid ena for october ' s estimate , of which megan would have paid the final bill on 12 / 26 / 01 when it was finalized . however , i had to pay the october bill directly last month , even though i had already sent the funds to ena in november . therefore , i essentially paid this bill twice ( once to ena in nov & once to txu in dec ) . i deducted the november agency fees from these receivable totals to show the net amount owed to cleburne . please advise as to the status of these bills . you can reach me at 713 - 853 - 7280 . thanks . james","ham"

if so , why don ' t they fly them ? why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes ? why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon ? you talk about japanese technocracy , and you get radios . you talk about german technocracy , and you get automobiles . you talk about american technocracy , and you find men on the moon - not once , but several times - and safely home again . you talk about scandals , and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at . even their draft - dodgers are not pursued and hounded . they are here on our streets , and most of them , unless they are breaking canadian laws , are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here . when the railways of france , germany and india were breaking down through age , it was the americans who rebuilt them . when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke , nobody loaned them an old caboose . both are still broke . i can name you 5000 times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble . can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble ? i don ' t think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake . our neighbors have faced it alone , and i ' m one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around . they will come out of this thing with their flag high . and when they do , they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles . i hope canada is not one of those . "" stand proud , america ! wear it proudly ! ! this is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states . it is nice that one man realizes it . i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it . we are always blamed for everything , and never even get a thank you for the things we do . i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web . i am just a single american that has read this , tribute to the united states = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ? easy unsubscribe click here : http : / / topica . com / u / ? a 84 vnf . a 9 ivhm ? or send an email to : brcc . yf - unsubscribe @ topica . com ? this email was sent to : dfarmer @ enron . com ? ? t o p i c a - - register now to manage your mail ! ? http : / / www . topica . com / partner / tago 2 / register ? = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =","ham"
"Subject: alternative work schedule status as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that was scheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will be provided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future . i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our first meeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes we know are needed in our work hours . here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting : schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and other contacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discuss at the next meeting . each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best for their desk and present this to the group at our next meeting bob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and follow up with hr on schedules being used at enron the following is what i heard at the first meeting : our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule that would more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you have the weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemed to doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels . cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a "" just do it "" attitude . there doesn ' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . however all solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it will be easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each desk changes . late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traders willingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what other companies are doing we might be able to find something that will help address this . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . and really have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job . there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to some type of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be open to a mandatory rotating weekend schedule . feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i ' m looking forward to our next meeting - bob","ham"

"Subject: texas general land office it transport gerald / eric - i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract 012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then , is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ? i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ? thanks for your help .","ham"

"Subject: organization announcement enron purchases billions of dollars of products through its wholly owned subsidiaries and venture companies worldwide . historically , the company has conducted these purchases in a highly fragmented , decentralized manner allowing each of the operating units the discretion to source their requirements in a manner that optimizes unit performance . today , however , with the implementation of sap and the profound explosion in internet / intranet - based technologies , we believe the company should change its direction and focus on aggregating its demand for goods and strategically sourcing these requirements on a global basis . we believe that there are significant cash savings to be extracted by the company and also commercial potential for the formation of a highly profitable , business - to - business e - commerce venture . effective february 1 , 2000 , enron will form a new global strategic sourcing unit . this new unit will consolidate the current successful strategic sourcing initiatives underway in the gas pipeline group , global asset operations and enron corp . initially , global strategic sourcing will focus on aggregating enron  , s internal , joint venture and business partner demand for products and services with the objective of creating a future business - to - business e - commerce venture . it gives us great pleasure to announce that george wasaff , managing director , will lead this new global initiative . george will report directly to mike mcconnell , chief executive officer for global technology . george has been with enron for fourteen years and has held many senior executive positions , the most recent of which was managing director of enron south america ' s wholesale operations . george was also the interim chief executive officer of elektro from july 1998 through june 1999 and chief executive officer of transportadora de gas del sur s . a .

( this has been the stated process for the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this process as well . ) please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team , yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team , or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment . thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process a meaningful one . it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0","ham"

"Subject: california energy crisis california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues . what happened in california the source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state . in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price . second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt . in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices . at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis . enron ' s role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts : ? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers . ? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility . you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a "" turnback "" of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts : ? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates . ? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices . ? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times . enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services . the solution the solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities . increasing supply california ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities . reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market . reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk . restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed . just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse . the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do . as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .","ham"

"Subject: northern natural gas yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . ken dear ets colleague : on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy . in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved . the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business . beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas . over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work ! stan","ham"

"Subject: tenaska iv gas daren , per review of the gas agreements between tenaska iv and williams / apache and our understanding of the agency agreement , i had a few items i wanted to discuss with you ( in lieu of our meeting today that was cancelled ) : 1 . looking at the october gas supply to the plant , i think tenaska iv should have been charged at the contract prices with williams & apache ( i . e . 2 . 285 ) and not at what the final price that was actualized per megan ' s summary - 230 , 406 at $ 710 , 616 . 70 , price of $ 3 . 084 . if this volume was charged at 2 . 285 the total would have been $ 526 , 477 . 71 , a difference of $ 184 , 138 . 99 . 2 . looking at the november gas supply to the plant , tenaska iv was charged $ 2 . 91 per mmbtu , instead of $ 2 . 285 for volumes of 267 , 300 . at the $ 2 . 91 price , the total settlement price was $ 777 , 843 instead of $ 610 , 780 . 50 at 2 . 285 , showing a difference of $ 167 , 062 . 50 . i reviewed the gas supply agreements and the williams gas price ( pg . 19 ) for 2000 gas is 2 . 32 , which can be adjusted by the waha transportation adjustment if delivered at waha . this adjustment started in 1997 at $ . 03 per mmbtu and increase by 5 % per year . thereby currently , the adjustment factor is at . 0347 , giving us a price of $ 2 . 2853 per mmbtu . in reviewing the apache gas agreement ( pg . 22 ) , i noticed that the gas price is 2 . 285 at waha & 2 . 315 at katy / carthage for 2000 . per review of the apache invoices , it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places ( i . e . lomak - sterling & mendell cdp ) at a price of $ 2 . 175 . if enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to enron . however , i think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of $ 2 . 285 . looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for november and october , i did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from williams and apache of 45 , 000 mmbtu per day . therefore i don ' t think spot prices are part of the equation here . additionally , i recall from our meeting last month that all enron makes on this deal is the agency fee of $ . 04 per mmbtu ( excluding the margin difference that enron has on apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct ) . so based upon items 1 & 2 above , i am suggesting that tenaska iv adjust their november invoice owed to enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above . therefore , i am planning to wire a payment of $ 484 , 234 . 03 ( see breakout below ) on friday , 12 / 22 , to enron on behalf of tenaska iv texas partners , ltd . for this activity . month plant gas price amount november 267 , 300 2 . 91 $ 777 , 843 november adjustment $ ( 167 , 062 . 50 ) october adjustment $ ( 184 , 138 . 99 ) nov . agency fee 1 , 350 , 000 . 04 $ 54 , 000 sept . agency fee 98 , 813 . 04 $ 3 , 592 . 52 total $ 484 , 234 . 03 i discussed these issues with mike mazowita , rick hill & jody pierce before reaching this conclusion . should you have any different ideas or thoughts that i am not covering , please call me at 3 - 7280 and we can discuss . thanks . james","ham"

"Subject: enron files chapter 11 reorganization to all employees : this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses : - - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . - - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . - - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . - - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future . ken","ham"

"Subject: new storage flag we are going to add a new drop down flag to storage in sitara to differentiate the difference between physical and synthetic storage - as each are treated differently for inventory accounting purposes . a change will also be made to global contracts and unify , and is intended to assist with oa variances on storage . on the next release ( mid august ) we will add a drop down on the storage deal type which will be a required field . someone will need to edit the existing deals to add the flag - as it will be a required field - physical facility or synthetic . ( we can create queries to work with you on identifying deals that need to be converted - as well as results for global conversion ) global contracts uses the flags from sitara to set up new contracts - so sitara will add the flag on the deal . the flag will be stored in global contracts - which will feed the flag to unify . once the existing deals are converted in sitara , global contracts can add the appropriate flag to their system . once this is complete and unify is ready , unify can begin to feed in the information from global contracts , and we will then be able to differentiate the two in the accounting system . in the interim time , you may want to identify your synthetic vs . physical storage deals . let me know if you have any questions .","ham"

( and his bong ) 4 . gorons actually believe that mr . gore is justified in illegally raising political funds from the office of the vp , simply because the vanderbilt law educated vp claims he was ignorant of the illegality . 5 . gorons further believe that it was ok for al to accept large sums of political money from china through buddhist monks who had taken vows of poverty , since he again claimed ignorance . 6 . gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "" invent the internet "" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of potentially incriminating e - mail ! 7 . gorons , incredibly , believe gore ' s claim that he and tipper were the models for the book and movie , "" love story "" even though the book ' s author , erich segal , says not . 8 . gorons , amazingly , believe that gore will be the consumer ' s champion against high gasoline prices although gore holds a million dollars in occidental petroleum stock . 9 . gorons applaud mr . lieberman ' s open rejection of president clinton ' s immorality , but believe it was fine for mr . gore to remain silent on the subject , while simultaneously declaring mr . clinton "" one of the greatest presidents of our history .

"" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .","spam"

"Subject: new version of stack manager introduction in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your products . this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . summary of new features multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child ( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed against a single parent . static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logout . sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key . parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) . detailed feature descriptions multiple children the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) . large vertical chains should be avoided . related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis link . static product bar prices the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons . one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rate . you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . sorting / selecting the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in alphabetical order ) . if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one another . parent products and f / x products one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent product . some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent , rather than managed individually . assistance as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . general feedback if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .","ham"

"Subject: ngi article on auction ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news : posted jan 9 , 2 : 28 pm dynegy not opposed to enron auction ; senate subcommittee to issue 51 subpoenas nearly 20 of bankrupt enron corp . ' s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company ' s trading assets this week , but one - time merger partner and creditor dynegy corp . will not be one of them , a spokesman said wednesday . however , whether the auction proceeds as planned , enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued friday by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the u . s . bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for enron ' s trading business , once the most profitable unit of the company . the motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale . included in the auction are assets from its enrononline operation , which enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash - rich company . under enron ' s proposal , a 51 % joint venture partner would form a new company with enron to be called new energy trading co . , or netco . enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things , in exchange for a 49 % stake . as of late monday , ubs ag , citigroup inc . and bp had made bids for some of the assets . among those opposing the auction , now set for thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as friday , is the royal bank of scotland group plc , which said , "" absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale , the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate , appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries . "" kansas city , mo - based aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used . aquila wants the auction ' s proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of enron receive the money . however , dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction , said company spokesman steve stengel , who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it . "" dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of enron ' s trading business , "" he told ngi . stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of northern natural gas co . from enron to dynegy is still set to close by the end of january . still to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the senate ' s permanent subcommittee on investigations . the subpoenas will be served on enron , its accounting firm andersen and 49 individual officers , employees and members of the board of directors . the subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the u . s . securities and exchange commission , the department of labor and the department of justice . "" the subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members , the role of the auditors , and the role of special - purpose entities , "" a subcommittee spokesman told reuters . these are some of the same types of things being investigated by the house of representatives financial services committee , the senate commerce committee and the house and senate energy committees . the spokesman said the subpoenas would allow enron and the others "" several weeks "" to respond .","ham"

"" i bought one of james ' cds from alex , and fell in love with it immediately . the cd was his second , called "" life in the laid back lane . "" little did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady "" shady floyd "" several times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real tour of the us since he moved "" down island "" almost twelve years ago . we got several chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article about this "" expatriate "" soon on "" the expatriate zone "" web site . be sure to watch for it . in the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great musician . when i asked him about his "" expatriate "" status , his reply was , "" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country , for whatever reason . for some it ' s legal reasons , others just because they want to , or that ' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly twelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience , from climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving , hot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying palms . "" even as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there were any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? "" maybe somewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within sailing distance of one another , "" was the advice he gave . until we can learn more of "" sunny jim ' s "" world , stop by his web site at and if you don ' t have one of his cds , including his latest release "" sandbar serenade , "" for goodness sake , pick one up . you can also read a great interview alex conducted with james at - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - travel into "" the zone "" "" some are running from the irs "" we strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens and out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one our most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops , cell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if we feel the need . but get real and throw that "" pager "" away as soon as you can . we hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from those of you already living your lives in "" the zone , "" helping the rest of us prepare for our getaway from the cities . i ' m sure there are some of us that are preparing to "" disappear "" to places like costa rica , where the "" the expatriate zone "" will become an important tool . how would you like to check out a place to "" disappear "" to and write it off your taxes at the same time ? want to go down into "" the zone "" to places like the bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic or saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a coral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ? well we have the answer . check out these organization ' s web sites , and then get some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations . depending on the tax bracket you ' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up to half the trip . the oceanic society earthwatch institute reef , the reef environmental education foundation after that , all that ' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember , "" no plane on sunday .

"" club trini ' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this april , one year after it ' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert pretty busy , so it ' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third in the "" margaritaville cafe - late nite "" series . i can ' t wait to hear it , as my wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was recorded . you can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini ' s revamped web site at . along with the great songs we ' ve become accustomed to , are a few i ' m pretty excited about . if you haven ' t heard ct ' s version of "" african friend "" you ' re in for a real treat . along with that , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this past summer , "" cario "" and bob marley ' s "" no woman , no cry . "" at the new web site , fans can "" now "" order their favorite club trini cds using their credit cards . so there ' s no excuse to not owning everything available . i think a true "" expatriate musical library "" is incomplete without club trini . this summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer ' s wardrobe designer , came up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the "" ice cream vendor "" shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok , pete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it ' s sleeves somewhere along the way . there ' s a great design that has been applied to a t - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - jesters and friends note card series tro - pics has just released their first note cards series from their "" jesters and friends "" original oils . friends , places and musicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and expatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times when an email just isn ' t personal enough . the original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and visit them . included in the "" jesters "" series are our good friends tim glancey and wally nickel . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - millennium change bubba style i ' ve got to tell you , i wasn ' t buying into this "" new millennium "" thing , one bit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year ' s eve show . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn ' t get the whole hype . but at the last minute , i had a change of heart . and now after being a special guest at seagram ' s party honoring the new margaritaville tequila , i ' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded together for me , making the millennium change over very special . if you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our new "" the expatriate zone "" web site at and go to the web version of this newsletter . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - flash ! ! !

"" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .","spam"

"Subject: message subject think getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ? think again ! we can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed . we work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote . click here now ! now that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search yields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review of the two systems . i have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit , both with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via an ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca adapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and sirius for a few months in the pacific northwest . the bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in sound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel quality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more channels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) . after careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have said . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and are streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its oft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm has an extra comedy channel ( it ' s boring , and features older , censored comedy ) , and a few more "" experimental "" music channels which most will find totally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular ( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it ' s no wonder xm doesn ' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you buy . also , xm ' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion . the greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are the staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the corporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying in an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that makes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you ' ve had it up loud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) . this , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my cancelling xm . xm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent music and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept xm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no matter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered everything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the talk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the useful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan . xm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius also has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) . however , xm doesn ' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all have to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for the house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where the corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .","spam"

"Subject: personal contact dear sir / madam , you may be surprise to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally . the purpose of my mail is that i am mr . peter stevens , the second son of dr . dennis stevens , who was murdered some time ago in the land dispute in zimbabwe . i am writing from holland ( the netherlands ) where i am currently based as a political asylum seeker . before the death of my father , he took me to amsterdam in holland to deposit the sum of ( us $ 18 . 9 m ) eighteen million , nine hundred thousand united states dollars only , in a private security and finance company . may be he for - saw the looming danger in zimbabwe ? but this money was put in a box as gemstones before it was deposited to avoid much tax and demurrage from the security company . this money was initially meant to purchase new machines and chemicals for the farms and also to establish a new farm in swaziland . the land problem came when the government of zimbabwe under the leadership of president robert mugabe , introduced a new land use decree / act that , affected a lot of rich white farmers and some few blacks . this resulted to the mob action and killing by zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society , so to say . infact , a lot of people were killed in this land reform act , including my father . it is against this back - ground , that i consulted with my family to transfer this money out of holland to a foreign account since i am now staying in holland and the law of netherlands , forbids a refugee ( asylum seeker ) to have such a money in an account . i am therefore saddled with the responsibility by my family to seek for a genuine person with foreign account to handle this transaction . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in the netherlands because ; i will not like to go through the same experience in future since both countries have similar history . moreover , the netherlands foreign exchange does not allow such investment from asylum seekers . i must let you know that this transaction is risk free . if you accept to assist me and my family , you will need to come to amsterdam the netherlands to open a non resident account which will aid us in the transfer of the money into any account you will provide . this money is meant for investment purpose in any lucrative business of your choice . i have two options of offers for your assistance . you may go into partnership with me in any business you decides to invest the money on with the shearing of the profit carefully spelt out if agreed upon , or you may decide to have 20 % of the total sum , 70 % will be for me and my family and the remaining 10 % will be set aside for un - forseen expenses that may be incurred in the cause of pursuing this transaction to a successful end . you may contact me on the above medias so that i know what your decision is , about this proposal . please note that your field of specialization is not a hindreance to this transaction . thank for your anticipated co - operations . peter stevens .","spam"

( gui display changes only at high level , not on path ) the scheduler has choice to repath ( if necessary ) , or not re - path if re - pathing occurs , the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path unify pushes back the deal number & meter to sitara ( not ctprty info ) balancing works on deal number & meter only ( not ctprty info ) the confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara ( where all information is correct ) volume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tie - out . ( all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly ) settlements utilizes information in unify . settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts , which would create two notification entries if invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty , re - draft would occur . ( note : there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting now ) autonoms "" tom ' s words of warning "" - previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated . basically it would change a key on an edi path ( duns number ) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline . if the scheduler re - nominated , data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem . in most cases , the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume . this is not an issue with unify ( as explained above ) .

( edi imbalance qtys would not match up to paths ) this may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities ( especially where nominations were sent for entire month ) can ' t remember the rules on this one , but i think unify does have some safe guards ( idiot proofs ) to force re - pathing . unify does have the ability to over - ride duns numbers , yet would still cause an additional step for edi the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response . what are ( if any ) impacts to vol mgt if counterparty name changes take place ?

"" some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - i assume for the same reasons we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems ( pre - unify ) . some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal . before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with their pipeline . sorry - i don ' t know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the unify team . there is one rule still in place - you can change from ena - im east to ena - im market east - but not from ena - im texas to hplc - im hplc - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity . "" warning - not the same legal entity "" also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals ( transport capacity , storage , cash out ) . once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules . don ' t forget - the items were locked down for a reason . if you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used these deals in unify - it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted . always check with someone from unify to make sure no one used these deals for anything in unify . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by thomas engel / hou / ect on 04 / 05 / 2000 09 : 47 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - from : scott mills on 04 / 04 / 2000 07 : 38 pm to : kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect cc : steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect , thomas engel / hou / ect @ ect , sylvia a campos / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , faye ellis / hou / ect @ ect , donna consemiu / hou / ect @ ect subject : sitara release ( re : changes in global due to consent to assignment ) with the release that was put out tuesday evening , deal validation should be able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other than expected ( e . g . confirmed , nominated , scheduled , etc . ) . in addition , this release will also capture "" near - time "" the contract changes that are made in global . this means that need for server bounces will not be necessary . new / changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal manager . new counterparties , and new / changes to facilities will require getting out of all active sitara apps ( except for launch pad ) . once out of all apps , start a new app - the respective information that you are looking for will appear . i mention "" near - time "" because we are constrained by the amount of time it takes for the change in global data to trigger an alert for sitara who then updates its information srm ( x 33548 ) cyndie balfour - flanagan @ enron 04 / 04 / 2000 03 : 41 pm to : connie sutton / hou / ect @ ect , linda s bryan / hou / ect @ ect , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , scott mills / hou / ect @ ect , richard elwood / hou / ect @ ect , dave nommensen / hou / ect @ ect , kenneth m harmon / hou / ect @ ect , dana daigle / corp / enron @ enron , kathryn cordes / hou / ect @ ect , elizabeth l hernandez / hou / ect @ ect , julie meyers / hou / ect @ ect , b scott palmer / hou / ect @ ect , stephanie sever / hou / ect @ ect , dianne j swiber / hou / ect @ ect , gayle horn / corp / enron @ enron , brant reves / hou / ect @ ect , russell diamond / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect , steve jackson / hou / ect @ ect cc : subject : changes in global due to consent to assignment the following changes will be made in the global contracts database due to receipt of executed consent to assignment for the following contracts : current counterparty name contract type contract # ' new ' counterparty name ces - commonwealth energy services gisb 96029892 commonwealth energy services ces - samuel gary jr . & associates , inc gisb 96029302 samuel gary jr . & associates ces - south jersey gas company gisb 96029143 south jersey gas company cp name change and contract type correction ( contract type different than that provided by ces ) per ces ces - southwest gas corporation 1 / 1 / 98 gisb 96029146 per contract file ces - southwest gas corporation 04 / 14 / 93 master purchase / sale interruptible ( will edit global # 96029146 ) & ces - southwest gas corporation 12 / 01 / 94 master sale firm ( created new global record to accommodate this k , # 96037402 ) please note that southwest gas corporation has consented to the assignment of both of these contracts .","ham"

"Subject: p & l tom , we attached both a consolidated p & l and an updated prudency schedule . the weater hedge made $ 165 , 000 today . the only odd thing that we saw was the physical change due to deal changes with the hplc operational desk . this desk is a desk that is set up to account for fuel , gas loss , and physical ua 4 , we have tickets out there with zero volumes on them that get updated after the month is over once volume management knows where the gas needs to be allocated . what we found out that happened was that in the last week of february and in the first week of march sitara added volumes to these tickets before were were running comparison reports to see the changes . darren noticed the incorrect volumes on these tickets and had logistics zero them out . darren thought that the changes would have no position effect as if it were a deal between hplc and texas , but it is actuall as if we changed a deal that we did with another region . the value was offset by changes in tufco and storage . we released $ 270 , 000 out of march prudency to keep you flat for the day . hope you had fun at the school function . i ' ll be here until about 8 : 30 , so feel free to call if you get this . bryan","ham"

"Subject: dear friend , dear friend , i wish to begin by way of introduction . i am williems tomu the first and only surviving son of late marc tomu one of the foremost and rich black farmers in zimbabwe recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe . before the death of my father , he had taken me to johannesburg - south africa , to deposit the sum of us $ 24 million ( tweenty four million united states dollars ) in one of the private security companies , as family valuables . when he realized the looming danger in zimbabwe . this amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms and also for the establishment of new farms in swaziland . this land dispute started when president robert mugabe introduced a new land reform , which was particularly targeted at the rich white farmers and a few black farmers ( my father included ) . this resulted in the gruesome killing of rich farmers ( mainly whites ) and the unlawful possession of their properties by mugabe ? s war veterans , under the disguise of fighting for the interest of the country . it is against this background that i fled the country with my family , to the netherlands where we are currently seeking asylum . i have decided to seek foreign assistance , as the netherlands law prohibits asylum seekers from operating bank accounts or involve in financial transaction of any kind , hence this letter to you . all i need is your trustworthiness to be able to entrust the above said amount and help me with investment opportunities . my family ? s survival depends on this money as we have virtually lost all our assets . there are two options , firstly , you can choose to accept 30 % of the total amount for your assistance or go into partnership for the proper investment of the money in your country . we shall discuss in detail the modalities involved when you reply providing me with your telephone fax numbers . i await your reply through this email below willamstomuj @ netscape . net , ) ( williamstomul @ netscape . net ) while i implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required to ensure a safe and hitch free transaction . i shall furnish you with more details on request . yours truly mr . williems tomu","spam"

"Subject: neon retreat ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time ! i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute . on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about . i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer . the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past . the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide . email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! ) have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy ! bobby","ham"

"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma - beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) . we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february . mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month . some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is this still the plan ? ? we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how conservative one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our maintenance . once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule will change ! lee 3 . 5923","ham"

"Subject: this was the one recommended to me finally ! i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex , even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really wants is an extra inch ! 3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it is really surprisingly comfortable and soft . i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original size . i was really surprised ! i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long ! the lengthening is permanent ! i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i forget ! take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your money back . every penny . no - one sends them back ! the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends as new cells grow ! check it out","spam"

"Subject: enron net works it is becoming increasingly clear that the development of ecommerce will have a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad array of industries . through enrononline , enron has quickly become a major catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries . enrononline has been an enormous success since its launch . since launch , we have completed 67 , 043 transactions on line , with a total dollar value of over $ 25 billion . enrononline is now the largest ecommerce site in the world . we believe that the competitive success of enrononline is due to one very specific reason . in addition to providing a web - based platform for transactions , enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the site . we stand ready at all times , in any market conditions , to buy and sell at the posted price . this converts a  & bulletin board  8 ( the more typical ecommerce concept ) into a true market . there are very few , if any , competitors that can provide this capability . we are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies . if we are correct , this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for enron . accordingly , we are initiating a major new effort to capture this opportunity . effective today we are creating a new business , enron net works , to pursue new market development opportunities in ecommerce across a broad range of industries . it is likely that this business will ultimately be our fifth business segment , joining transmission mike mcconnell , chief operating officer ; and jeff mcmahon , chief commercial officer . these individuals will comprise the office of the chairman for enron net works and remain on the executive committee of enron corp . replacing greg whalley as president and chief operating officer of enron north america is dave delainey , who will also join enron  , s executive committee . global technology will remain intact but will now be a part of enron net works . it will maintain all of the same businesses and services as it did as an enron global function . philippe bibi will remain the chief technology officer for all of enron corp . and continues to be responsible for the development of worldwide technology standards and platforms . enrononline , headed by louise kitchen , will also remain intact and will now be a part of enron net works . the success of enrononline enables us to utilize this site as a model as we explore other markets . in addition , the following individuals are included in enron net works along with their current ecommerce initiatives : harry arora , public financial securities ; jay fitzgerald , new markets identification ; bruce garner , metals ; and greg piper , pulp and paper . over the next several weeks we will complete staffing and organizational design and will provide full details on this exciting new business opportunity .","ham"

"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country . due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer is a violation of federal case law . as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok . i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no problem . i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth , and call it ecology . i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and ignorant and call it enlightenment . however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is violated . this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical . apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and his commandments . nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an intentional transgression . for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor , praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event , please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law - yet . "" and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one nation under god . somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion . praise god that his remnant remains ! let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001 jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my father . "" - - - - - - - - - if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it . yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that strengthens me . phil 4 : 13 geoff gayle synergy oil & gas , inc . office : ( 713 ) 461 - 6626 x . 113 fax : ( 713 ) 461 - 4475 email : ggayle @ synergyog . com to unsubscribe , write to - unsubscribe @ listbot . com","ham"

"Subject: marketing services / scheduling daren , thinking about robert ' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that idea . it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing , nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor . it is a "" who ' s on first "" issue . if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops . i ' m sure this would help volume management and client services immensely . as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture . i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling to handle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrials . i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alright . once again , thanks for listening . ken - attl . htm","ham"

"Subject: some after thoughts to our meeting hi daren , i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning . you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share . you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and you seek to expand it in the team . this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in the problem ? there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual team members ? i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing ! mike teamleadership center mobile : 713 - 598 - 6732 office : 713 - 871 - 8326 fax : 713 - 871 - 1707 home : 409 - 321 - 0680 mam @ teamlead . com","ham"

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy to see . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep this mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on . another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment gauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you clamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the "" wiggling "" that often occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip ! a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great to hear that so many people are enjoying the tips . talk to you again in a few weeks . jon garbison on - line editor woodsmith visit our other woodworking and home improvement sites : 100 + woodworking plans : woodsmith magazine : shopnotes magazine : workbench magazine : kits , jigs , tools , project plans : back issues : woodworking forums : to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at to unsubscribe , send empty email message to : note : your subscribed email address is","ham"

"Subject: we can date : september 21 , 2004 . sir , details during the regime of president charles taylor in liberia , i was the special adviser to the president on minerals and allied matters . also , i was made the chairman of the presidential task force on sales and exportation of diamonds and other gem stones , which are the major mineral deposits in liberia . the above positions availed me the opportunity to divert some fund , which was deposited with a private security vault firm in europe . this i did due to the instability in liberia during the regime of charles taylor , in order to safeguard my future and the future of my entire family . you may be aware of the protracted war in liberia . the political uncertainty is very unfriendly . the government of charles taylor , under which i served , had been discredited by the western world , especially the united states who forcefully removed the president and his cabinet and sent them to exile . this is the reason why i am in asylum in the nigeria being a top member of charles taylor? ? ts cabinet . thank god , the intention for which i diverted the fund was instantly justified at the inception of a new transition government . all the members of the former regime , including me , were put under probe . our assets were confiscated . all traceable bank accounts , both in liberia and overseas , were frozen , pending the findings of the probe committee or probable pardon by the new regime . my only fund that could not be traced is the fund i diverted to the private security vault company in netherlands . the deposit was made in the form of ? ?  concealed lodgment? ?  and the deposit manifest was made as diamonds and family treasures . the only person that is aware of this deposit is my personal lawyer , who i can trust , and you , who i have just told in utmost confidence . please , let it be so and may god help us . the amount in question is usd $ 15 million ( fifteen million dollars ) . this is the fund i want to invest , through an honest and trusted ally , in any good business in any country outside the continent of africa . this necessitated my search for a competent and reliable person who will oversee the investment on the basis of a joint venture partnership for our mutual benefit . my initial idea was to invest this fund in real estate . but your choice of any other business eitherin your country in any other country other than africa will be appreciated . the details of the partnership terms will be drafted by my lawyer on confirmation of your willingness to assist in this venture . also , a meeting could be arranged between you and my lawyer who is based here . this will enable us sign a memorandum of understanding before the fund will be transferred from the security vault company to your custody . i look forward to your prompt response as i wish to move this fund out of the vault company due to high cost of deposit contract renewal . regards . please replyonly through this email address : nathanielbarnes @ sify . com yours truly , nathaniel barneswalla ! mail - get your free lg mail today ","spam"

to - day activities of 15 independent business units has become increasingly difficult . third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding asset positions . and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities . enron wholesale services today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and markets . enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this new structure as described below . mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley , currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office of the chairman as president and chief operating officer . providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership positions : rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will report to the ews office of the chairman . sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business into enron global assets in the near future . diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to the ebs office of the chairman . jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the transition , jim will join ees . in addition to these changes in our international asset operations activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale businesses and the commercial support functions : enron net works louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg . enron americas concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading , marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron americas . enron europe the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer . enron global markets enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance , equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products . enron industrial markets enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon , president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged . commercial support for ews the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by , the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews . to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these newly defined roles are as follows : mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works , with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible for specific commodities and / or geographic locations . legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews . regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity , enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets . these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship to mark palmer , vice president of communications . business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america . attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes . enron global exploration and production and enron wind as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron wind , will report to cliff . corporate staff we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources , government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief of staff . committee structure in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be drawing on this group to lead company -

( ndin ) commented today on the recent announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications commission ( crtc ) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol ( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service . in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to stifle competition . the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter the canadian market with our products via internet service providers , cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework , stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad international inc . the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization worldwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the u . s . alone , there are over 20 o , ooo , 0 oo users of the internet . of the total users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40 , oo 0 , 000 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market . the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher . nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration , but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product . about nomad international inc . nomad international inc . is a multi - national internet communications company developing cost effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol ( voip ) technologies . the company ' s revolutionary voip product line called nomad systems that has dial - up , broadband , dsl , cable , satellite and wireless capabilities . the company plans on targeting : 1 ) national fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace , 2 ) large multinational corporations which need to have us or european presence by having , ( for example ) , a united states number ringing in their offices in guatemala or london - - offering business partners a more economical way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their relatives in their country of origin . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is ndin poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade monday ! go ndin . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 30 oo dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . if you wish to stop future mailings , or if you feel you have been wrongfully placed in our membership , send a blank e mail with no thanks in the sub ject to ournewsletter 24 @ yahoo . com","spam"

[ 65 , 229 ] in both cases , the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence , id . in its order setting this proceeding for hearing , the commission took note of edison ' s proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design , commission order issued march 30 , 1979 , mimeo at 4 - 5 . on october 9 , 1980 , the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential . the requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential , as discussed supra , is also set forth in the commission ' s filing requirements for rate schedules : if the rate design is intended to reflect costs , the applicant must show how it reflects costs ; if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs , the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates , 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . edison ' s seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak . edison reasons that , since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak , charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and , therefore , edison ' s cost of adding capacity would be reduced ( tr . 169 ) . accordingly , edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand , under the commission ' s filing requirements in 18 cfr o 35 . 13 ( b ) ( 4 ) ( iii ) statement p . further , even purpa section 111 ( d ) ( 4 ) relied upon by edison states that rates "" shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . "" ( emphasis added . ) further , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for hearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order no . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principles [ 65 , 236 ] for jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case , where the sale of economy energy is related to edison ' s costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs . accordingly , winnetka ' s position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted . affirmed and reversed - see next paragraph comm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ? 61 , 219 , commonwealth edison company , docket nos . er 79 - 182 - 000 and er 80 - 106 - 000 , ( may 12 , 1983 ) turning to commonwealth ' s exceptions , we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential . even if we accept the company ' s interpretation of purpa , it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months . without at least some showing of a cost difference , it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the company ' s 15 . 25 % proposal . we therefore uphold the judge on this point . we reverse the judge ' s adoption of a price set at 110 % of the utility ' s incremental costs , however , and approve the type - b split - savings method proposed by commonwealth . under this method , economy transactions are arranged for a 12 - hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement . if the utility ' s incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome , the utility may terminate supply . we find this method superior to that proposed by staff in that implementation is greatly simplified . cost determinations need not be made as frequently . related to pmas reg - preamble , fercsr ? 36 , 710 , procedures for public participation in power and transmission rate adjustments and extensions , december 31 , 1980 , 10 cfr 903 , 45 fr 86976 [ 36 , 741 ] historically , many purpa - type standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power . pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates . declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules . many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules , such as scheduling limitations , loadshaping , capacity and energy overrun charges , etc . bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago . southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957 . these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpa - type standards where applicable . many of these purpa - type standards , when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates , can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy , efficient use of resources and facilities , and equitable rates . the public participation process will provide an opportunity to examine these and other appropriate concepts . the pmas will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices on a system - by - system basis to serve the purpa objectives . the assistant secretary for resource applications , working with the administrators of the power administrations , and after receiving public comment , will consider the adoption of rate design guidelines , similar in form to the guidelines in ra 6120 . 2 on financial accounting and ratemaking , which will reflect the experience gained by the pmas in their system - by - system approach to rate design . related to purpa fed - law , fercsr ? 5021 , purpa , sec . 111 . consideration and determination respecting certain ratemaking standards . ( 4 ) seasonal rates . - - the rates charged by an electric utility for providing electric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility . fed - reg - notice , fercsr ? 37 , 503 , doe responsibilities under title i of purpa ( 4 ) seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season ; prop - reg - preamble , fercsr 1988 - 1998 ? 32 , 457 , administrative determination of full avoided costs , sales of power to qualifying facilities , and inter - connection facilities , march 16 , 1988 , docket no . rm 88 - 6 - 000 , 53 fr 9331 , 55 fr 31882 pricing flexibility may take several different forms . for instance , a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility , but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods . the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while [ 32 , 174 ] the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peak - load periods when the utility values additional supplies most . of course , the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility ' s avoided cost . similarly , a contract could provide for a two part price - - a fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered . the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity . the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic . whatever the pattern of contract payments , rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers ' power match the purchasing utility ' s need . this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs ( rather than the guaranteed average rate ) and , at the same time , will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors . to avoid problems such as those associated with take - or - pay contracts in the natural gas industry , the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long - term contracts , especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase quantities . the commission also encourages the use of time - of - day and seasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long - term contracts . reg - preamble , fercsr 1977 - 1981 ? 30 , 128 , small power production and cogeneration facilities ; regulations implementing section 210 of the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 , order no . 69 , february 25 , 1980 , docket no . rm 79 - 55 , 18 cfr 292 , 45 fr 12214 , 45 fr . . . rather than specifying that exact time - of - day or seasonal rates for purchases are required , however , the commission believes that the selection of a methodology is best left to the state regulatory authorities and nonregulated electric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions .","ham"
